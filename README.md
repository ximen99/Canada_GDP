# Canada_GDP

As a new comer in Canada and a finance/data guy, in order to gain a more understanding of this country, I wrote this explainatory data analysis of Canada's GDP growth data by using the data from [Statistics Canada.  Table  36-10-0434-02   Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, by industry, monthly, growth rates (x 1,000,000)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610043402)

There are three data files used in this analysis. 
1. gdp.csv is the main data file used for analysis that contains the monthly by industry gdp data.
2. gdp_meta.csv contains meta data for the main gdp.csv data column. 
3. gdp_sample.csv is used as a template to select key industries that we are mainly used in this analysis.

In this EDA, I delved into the Canada's GDP growth trend, composition, industry contribution and the interaction among various industries. Generally besides a large drop during financial crisis, Canada's gdp maintained steady growth around 2% every year. By industry data shows very different growth trend, with manufacturing and mining industry falling behind while real estate, tech, financial industry become a stronger driver in the countries economic growth.
